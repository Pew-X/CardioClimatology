# CardioClimatology

This project endeavors to employ machine learning algorithms for predicting the future prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) on a state-by-state level. The predictions are based on the analysis of weather and climatic data. The primary objective is to explore the interplay between environmental factors and the occurrence of CVD, with the ultimate aim of developing predictive models. These models are intended to offer valuable insights into potential trends in cardiovascular health across various regions in the coming years.
